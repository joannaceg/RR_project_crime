## Introduction

**Aim of the project:**

Reproduce the results of a bachelor thesis study prepared in 2019 by Joanna Ceglinska and extend the research

**Modifications:**

* different software (R and Python instead of STATA)

* bigger dataset (added two more years and added two variables) 

* new method of missing data imputation

* implementing more advanced methods of data analysis and visualization


## The dataset comparison 

**Common characteristics:**

* 48 countries (the full list is available in the report)

* Homicide rate as the dependent variable

<div class="column-left">
 **Original**

* Years 2003-2015
* 8 independent variables
* 624 observations in total

</div>
<div class="column-right">
**Extended**

* Years 2003-2017 
* Two additional variables (10 in total): 
  1. Research and development expenditure 
  2. Percentage of urban population in total
* 720 observations in total

</div>
