## Main idea

The aim of this project is the repetition, reproduction and replication of the results of a bachelor thesis study prepared in 2019 by one of the project's authors.

Knowing the methodology used in the study, it will be checked whether the results remain the same when repeating individual steps. Then it will be tested whether the outcome remains stable when extending the analysis to alternative, more advanced methods. Finally, the correctness of the conclusions will be also be checked with other initial assumptions and perhaps different transformations of the variables. In addition, we plan to include new observations in the model and possibly a new explanatory variable.

The topic of the research was investigating the determinants of crime based on annual panel data for 48 countries for the years 2003-2015. The dependent variable was the homicide rate, while independent variables include the Gini index, GDP per capita, unemployment rate, variables responsible for measuring the education level in a country and a regressor which presents the effectiveness of judicial system.

The results of the empirical study can provide guidance to those responsible for national development as to how policies should be conducted to ensure the safety of citizens.


## Description of the dataset

The data for this study come mainly from the World Bank and, for European countries, from the Eurostat database. Due to numerous data gaps, SWIID (Standardized World Income Inequality Database) was used, which takes into account the estimated values ​​of the Gini index from institutions collecting information on income inequalities in various regions of the world (Luxembourg Income Study, Socio-Economic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean, Survey of Income and Living Condition, OECD Income Distribution Database, World Bank's Eastern). 

The selection of data in the final SWIID compilation resulted from the size of the databases - in the first place, the most extensive sets containing the most observations were used, and the gaps were supplemented with values ​​from other sources. In the case of different values ​​for the same observation, the value from a larger base was selected. The final version of the data set was created on the basis of three sources - the World Bank, Eurostat and SWIID.


## Variables in the model

The dependent variable in the model in the study is the homicide rate, i.e. the estimated number of homicides per 100,000 inhabitants. Homicide is defined as the deliberate death of another person as a result of violence.

Independent variables were carefully selected on the basis of the literature on the subject. They are:
* income inequality,
* GDP per capita, expressed in USD at 2017 prices,
* unemployment rate,
* number of years of compulsory education in the country,
* ratio of people undertaking higher education in relation to the age group who graduated from secondary school in a given year,
* number of people who completed secondary education in relation to people in the age group who, following the curriculum, should graduate from secondary school,
* number of police officers per 100,000 residents,
* number of undeclared arrested people in relation to the number of prisoners.


## Research hypotheses

The literature review prompts us to formulate hypotheses as to the influence of selected variables on the dependent variable, which will be verified in an empirical study. The hypotheses posed in the bachelor's thesis on which we base the project are as follows:

* Income inequality and GDP per capita have a negative effect on the homicide rate.
* The level of education in a country influences crime (the higher the level, the lower the crime).
* The ease of detecting a crime acts as a deterrent to the decision to commit a crime.
* Poor labor market conditions in the country have a positive effect on the homicide rate.
* The effectiveness of the justice system has a positive effect on the homicide rate.
